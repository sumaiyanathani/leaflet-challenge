# leaflet-challenge

This challenge pertains to creating map visualizations using the leaflet library. Earthquake data from the past week was obtained from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php. Earthquakes with deeper focus were darker in color as can be seen via the legend and earthquakes with greater magnitudes are shown having bigger radii.  

The javascript code can be found in the logic.js file and the html code can be found in the index.html file.
